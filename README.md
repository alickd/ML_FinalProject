# ML_FinalProject

This code demonstrates machine learning principles using KNN, Naive Bayes, and Scaled Vector Method algorithms for classification of data.

In SEP 787 project, our team ws given the task to predict the outcome of a patient with diabetes based on the variables provided in the dataset. Using KNN, Naive Bayes, and Adaboost algorithms, our team classifed the outcome and displayed the results using hte confusion matrix and ROC curve.

In SEP 786 project, our team was given the task to use PCA and Feature Selction on the IRIS dataset to classify the type of flower.
